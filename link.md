###Low latency network tuning
```
IRQ Processing
The irqbalance daemon is a system utility that optimizes CPU usage by balancing interrupt loads across multiple CPUs. It identifies the most active interrupt sources and assigns them to a single unique CPU, thereby spreading the workload and minimizing cache rate misses for interrupt handlers. This helps to balance CPU load and improve overall system performance.

To run irqbalance, use the irqbalance --oneshot command with the --debug3 flag if necessary.
```

###TCP max tw buckets
```
The kernel parameter controls the maximum number of TCP time-wait (tw) buckets allowed in the system. A tw bucket is used to store information about a closed TCP connection. If the number of tw buckets exceeds this limit, the system will start dropping new incoming connections. This parameter helps prevent a Denial of Service (DoS) attack by limiting the number of tw buckets. The default value is 262144.
```

###TCP Congestion Control
```
Congestion control is the TCP protocol's method of managing data flow over a network and preventing congestion - queuing delay, packet loss or blocking new connections.

TCP supports several congestion algorithms, to enable each of them you need to load the module. The default is the Reno algorithm, the Cubic and BBR are also available. The algorithms available in your kernel can be checked with the next command: sysctl net.ipv4.tcp_available_congestion_control.

In Linux/Intel I would use following methodology for performance analysis:

Hardware:

    turbostat
    Look for C/P states for cores, frequencies, number of SMIs. [1]
    cpufreq-info
    Look for current driver, frequencies, and governor.
    atop
    Look for interrupt distribution across cores
    Look for context switches, interrupts.
    ethtool
    -S for stats, look for errors, drops, overruns, missed interrupts, etc
    -k for offloads, enable GRO/GSO, rss(/rps/rfs)/xps
    -g for ring sizes, increase
    -c for interrupt coalescing

Kernel:

    /proc/net/softirq[2] and /proc/interrupts[3]
    Again, distribution, missed, delayed interrupts, (optional) NUMA-affinity
    perf top
    Look where kernel/benchmark spends its time.
    iptables
    Look if there are rules (if any) that may affect performance.
    netstat -s, netstat -m, /proc/net/*
    Look for error counters and buffer counts
    sysctl / grub
    So much to tweak here. Try increasing hashtable sizes, playing with memory buffers, congestion control, and other knobs.

In your case your main problem is interrupt distribution across the cores, so fixing it will be your best corse of action.

PS. Do not forget that in those kinds of benchmarks kernel and driver/firmware versions play a significant role.

PPS. You probably want to install the newest ixgbe driver from Intel[4]. Do not forget to read README there and examine scripts directory. It has lots of performance-related tips.
